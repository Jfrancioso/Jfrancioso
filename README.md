# Hi there, I'm Joey ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Ohio with a passion for building web applications and exploring new technologies. My current interests include C# and .NET, MSSQL, and Unity.

Outside of work, I am passionate about cultivating meaningful relationships and promoting proactive health management. I find inspiration in the possibility of a multi-planetary species and the empowerment of Earth through empathy. I am excited about the opportunity to work on impactful software that can make a positive difference in the world.

And of course, I spend most of my free time with my favorite cat named Mars!

## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on two projects **Purrfect Flight** && **PlatoonMedic**, a unity side scroller game that's cat themed, and a medical tracker for military medics in their respective platoons!
- ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning new things and exploring new technologies to build better software.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I got started in coding, how I can help you with your projects, or anything else that comes to mind!
